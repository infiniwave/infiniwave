## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting! I'm a full stack developer, IT person, urbanist, musician, and student. 

I'm also the main developer at [Nextflow](https://nextflow.cloud), an open source project I created. Nextflow services typically use TypeScript and Rust. It would be greatly appreciated if you are interested in helping.

You may contact me at infiniwave@nextflow.cloud.
